phpstorm laravel live templates or snippets

How to add in phpstorm:

1) Download and copy the xml file(s) to your templates folder:

    Windows: <your home directory>\.<product name><version number>\config\templates
    Linux: ~\.<product name><version number>\config\templates
    OS X: ~/Library/Preferences/<product name><version number>/templates

e.g. ~/Library/Preferences/PhpStorm2016.1/templates on OS X for PhpStorm 2016 C:\Users\Hardik.PhpStorm2016.1\config\templates on Windows 8.1

2) Restart PhpStorm.

3) To see all templates, go to File->Settings->Editor->Live Templates and expand the Template Group.

It's hard to remember shortcuts when there are a large number of options. A more efficient way is to take advantage of PhpStorm's Insert Live Template shortcut. Type as few or as many letters as you want and press Ctrl + Space. Then continue typing to filter the options.

For example, for the jQuery Ready method, type hjq and press Ctrl + Space.
